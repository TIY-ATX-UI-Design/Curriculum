    + plan
    + observe
    + design
    + prototype
    + test
- Why design research?
    + seeking out data and information to inform design decisions
    + Erika Hall's Just Enough Research reasons for design research
        * solves a design problem (that the client may or may not be aware of )
        * Discover cultural, social, or economical factors that may not have been previously obvious
            - http://alistapart.com/article/culturalprobe
        * competitive edge
        * setting valid goals for the forseeable future
    + Why else?
        * figure out the company and the user's core purposes (may be different)
        * use research to narrow down options
        * add value to the design

- Benefits of Design Research 
    + defend decisions
    + get designers, developers, and clients on the same page (kickoff meeting)
    + design based on fact rather than assumption 
    + design based on the needs of the user (no more I likes!)
    + sets us up with a strategy rather than a blank page
- What happens without research?
    + risk factors go up
        * going off brand
        * possibility of insulting the audience
            - #whyIstayed by Dijorno
        * harming user experience
        * mismatched trends applied to product design
    + heavy reliance on design trends that aren't necessarily the best option for the company/user
        * hamburger menu
            - test
        * flat design: resurgence of modernism
        * parallax scrolling:
            - bloated, not cross-browser friendly
            - more effort to scroll
            - studies show it can cause vestibular side effects or vertigo in 30% of people
    + decisions become subjective
    + don't solve the right problem
