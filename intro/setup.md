#Setup
Make sure to have all of the following items for the first day of class :)

##Accounts
Sign up for thesea accounts and follow me (@abbylarner):

- [Github](http://github.com)
- [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) - Use your Github account to sign up for Codepen
- Slack - you will recieve an invitation from Karly or Travis, once you do, make sure to download the Slack desktop application, and I recommend dowloading the mobile app as well.
- [Twitter](http://twitter.com)- Not required, but recommended to start getting your name out in the design world

##Adobe
Sign up for [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://creative.adobe.com/plans) (if you don't already have Adobe CS4 or higher). You can use everything free for the first 30 days but the will have to pay for at least the 12 weeks of class. 

There are two options we recommend:

**Option 1**
- The CC annual account, paid monthly: $49.99 for all of the programs if the you agree to one year contract Total student cost for 4 months = $200 plus tax (plus remaining 8 months = $600 plus tax)

**Option 2**
- The CC monthly account month-to-month pricing: $74.99 for all of the programs (without cancellation fees) Total student cost for 4 months = $300 plus tax

If you are using the free trial, we won't need it for the first couple of weeks.  I'll let you know when we do.  However, downloading these programs takes a while, so please do it before you get to class.
