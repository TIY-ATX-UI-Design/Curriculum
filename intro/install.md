# Install Instructions

Normally you *NEVER* want to run random commands that you get from the internet in your terminal without understanding what they are and exactly what they do. The terminal could give anyone full access to your entire computer. In this case these commands are coming from a trusted source (me) so it's okay. **Anywhere you have to make a public facing account, be aware that employers may see your handle/username.  Make sure to pick something professional.  I also like to make sure my handles and profile pictures match across services so I'm easier to find.**

**Option 2**
- The CC monthly account month-to-month pricing: $74.99 for all of the programs (without cancellation fees) Total student cost for 4 months = $300 plus tax

If you are using the free trial, we won't need it for the first couple of weeks.  I'll let you know when we do.  However, downloading these programs takes a while, so please do it before you get to class.
