#Welcome!

Welcome to The Iron Yard UI Design course! I'm so excited to get to know you, to challenge you, and to give you the tools you need to be a successful designer.  Although there are still a few weeks until class starts, there is a lot to be done!  

Best,
Abby

##Schedule 
- Class is from February 29th to May 20th.
- Career Support lectures run from May 20th - May 27th. (So don't plan to skip town after classes are over!)
- Lecture is daily from 9:00 AM to 12:00 Monday-Thursday, with breaks during that time. Depending on the topic, we may end earlier or later. :-)
- Lab time is from 1 PM to 5 PM Monday-Thursday and 9 AM to 5 PM on Friday!
- Campus Huddle is from 10 AM - 10:30 AM on Friday (it is mandatory).
- Iron Pints happy hour starts at 4ish on Fridays and will either be on campus or at Opal Divine's

##Office Hours and One-on-One Instruction
I will be available Monday-Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM at minimum. During lab time, you can schedule one-on-one time with me. After hours, I may be available in the classroom or on Slack, which we will use for group communication.

##Policies
Sounds boring, but these are important:

- Absences and timeliness - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in career support is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! :-) Also, please show up on time. We count 2 lates as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

- Late or incomplete homework - Your homework is due by 12 midnight on the assigned day. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

- Honor - You are expected to do your own work. If you don't, why are you here? You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger project. Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting career support.

- Conduct - I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally spoken, if something can be taken the wrong way, be careful how you say it! Got an issue with someone? If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, and we generally care for the well-being of our students.
