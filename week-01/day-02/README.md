## Notes
HTML Elements can generally be broken down into one of two categories: inline, and block-level.

##### Inline elements
Think of them as bratty teenagers.
* They want to be near their friends:
  * They will move as close in to neighboring elements as those neighboring elements will allow.
* They are disrespectful:
  * aka: ignoring height, width, margin-top or margin-bottom
* For a full list of inline elements available see the [MDN Documentation for inline elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements)

##### Block-level elements
Think of them as proud parents.
* They are proud:
  * They will swell up to fill as much space (left to right) as is available
  * Even if they are not full width, they still don't allow anyone to be next to them.
* They are very respectful:
  * aka: comply with height, width, and all margins
* For a full list of inline elements available see the [MDN Documentation for block-level elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements)
